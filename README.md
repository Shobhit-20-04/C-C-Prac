# C++ Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs designed to practice fundamental concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository includes various C++ programs categorized as follows:

- **Basics**: Simple programs to get started with C++ (input/output, variables, loops, functions, etc.).
- **Conditional Statements**: Programs using `if-else`, `switch-case`, and logical operators.
- **Loops & Iterations**: Implementations of loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **Arrays & Strings**: Programs covering array manipulations and string handling.
- **Functions & Recursion**: Function-based solutions and recursive programs.
- **Pointers & Dynamic Memory**: Concepts related to pointers, memory allocation, and deallocation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: C++ programs demonstrating `classes`, `objects`, `inheritance`, `polymorphism`, etc.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files using C++.

## üöÄ How to Use

To compile and run a program, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shobhit-20-04/CPP-Practice.git
cd CPP-Practice
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Compile a Program
Use a C++ compiler like g++:
```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Compiled Program
```sh
./output
```
Replace filename.cpp with the actual program file name.
